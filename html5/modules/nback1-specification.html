                    Description:<br>
                    The user is asked to compare the <b>position</b> of a letter displayed on the screen to the position of the first letter presented.  <br>
                    If it match, letter "M" is pressed and if it doesn't letter "N" is pressed as quickly as possible.<br>
                    Every 4.5 seconds, one of 12 possible capital-letter stimuli appears in one of
                    12 possible locations on a computer monitor. The location of the stimulus is one of 12 locations on a imaginary circular grid (not visible). The possible stimulus locations are the intersection points of six equidistant imaginary radii of two imaginary circles, one at 1 cm and the other at 3.5 cm from the centre of the screen (the inner and outer circles of this array respectively subtend approximately 1.5 degrees and 4.5 degrees visual angle). Only a small fixation point is present in the center of the grid.<br>
                    &#9679;	the letters are white; the background is black<br>
                    &#9679;	The following 12 letters are used: B C F H L M P T W X Y Z<br>
                    &#9679;	Letter name and letter position occur with equal probability.<br>
                    The display field of the task on the PC screen is quite small, to minimize eye movements. The identity of the letters is easily distinguished without having to foveate on it.<br>

                    This capital-letter stimulus is presented for 250 milliseconds. At 1.5 seconds prior to stimulus onset, a warning cue (big green dot) in the centre of the screen appears for 200 milliseconds. The letter stimulus occurs 1.3 seconds after the cue disappears. The identity of the letter and its spatial position vary randomly from trial to trial. Matches occur on 50% of the trials. Important to make the randomisation before start to make it even. A test block, consisting of 50 trials, preceded by 1 redundant + 3 warmup trials (discarded from analysis), has a duration of 4 minutes and 3 seconds. <br>

                    This task compares the position of letters displayed on the screen.<br>
                    Remember the position of the first letter.<br>
                    Compare it to the position of all other letters.<br>
                    If the position of the current letter matches the position of the first letter press M on the keyboard for Match as quickly as possible.<br>
                    If the position of the current letter does not match press N for No Match as quickly as possible.<br>
                    To begin, press the start button (A green dot will warn you that a letter is about to appear)<br>
                    This task starts IMMEDIATELY after pressing start<br>
